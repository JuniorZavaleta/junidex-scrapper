# Junidex Scrapper

Scrapper to get easily sprites animated from WikiDex.

If you are using [Junidex](https://github.com/shuni95/junidex) put images downloaded in `/static/img`

Probably i'll add some scripts more to get other sprites. It depends on Junidex project...

## Steps to get the sprites

- Install python from [here](https://www.python.org/)
- Download this repo and Go to the folder unzipped or cloned from Git.
- Install the libraries needed (`pip install -r requirements.txt` in your console)
- Run `python scrapper.py` and wait, it takes some time to download. At least for me.

## To donwload only one sprite and the artwork version
- Run `python pokeapi.py {pokemon}`
